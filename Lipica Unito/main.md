# Lipica Unito

Over 85 milion years during Cretaceous period, under the clear waters from tiny shells, and bones from countless sear creatures and sands pressed together to form a special rock called **Lipica Unito**. This smooth gray limestone from Karst region is known for tiny fossil bits that catch the light, giving it a soft shimmer.

## The Birthplace

Lipica Unito—and its flowery-patterned sister, Lipica Fiorito—come from the same rocky home: the Karst plateau near the village of Lipica in southwest Slovenia. For hundreds of years, quarry workers followed its grey stripes in small, open pits.

In 1986 the work moved below ground when Marmor Sežana opened the Lipica II quarry, a hidden “stone cathedral” sitting 50 m under the surface. Diamond-wire saws cut perfect 20-tonne blocks while the land above stays almost untouched.

Whether taken from the sunny pits or Lipica II’s cool echoing halls, every piece of Lipica Unito shows the plateau’s silver-grey colour sprinkled with tiny fossils, linking today’s buildings to a stoneworking story that stretches across centuries and over 80 years of modern

## Three True Tales of Lipica Unito

**1. The Imperial Stud Farm (1580)**
When Archduke Charles II chose the windy Karst plateau for his new Lipica Stud Farm, he built the stables and manor from the grey limestone lying beneath the horses’ hooves. Local masons shaped Lipica Unito into cool, thick walls that stayed refreshingly chill in summer and snug in the bora gales of winter. Grooms swear that running a hand across the fossil-flecked doorframes still brings good luck before a dressage show—proof that stone and stallion share the same calm spirit.

**2. Rails to Ringstrasse (1857-1918)**
The 1857 Trieste–Vienna railway turned Karst quarries into express suppliers for the booming Habsburg capital. Wagon-loads of Lipica Unito rattled north each night, destined for the grand Ringstrasse. There, architects tucked the silver-grey blocks into façades and window tracery of the new Votive Church and surrounding townhouses. Decades later, geologist Alois Kieslinger traced the stone’s fossil patterns and confirmed its origin. Modern restorers still order fresh Unito from the same quarry because the century-old carvings have out-weathered neighboring sandstones—testament to a limestone that travels well and ages even better.

**3. A Skyscraper Takes Flight (1933)**
Ljubljana’s Nebotičnik rose 70 m, daringly modern for its time. Yet its architects grounded the tower in tradition, lining every lift lobby and the shimmer of the entrance floor with polished Lipica Unito. Residents joked the elevators shot “from Karst to the clouds,” because the same stone that paved their village squares now whisked them skyward. Ninety years on, the grey panels still gleam—proving the rock can swap shepherd paths for Art-Deco glamour without losing a grain of its soul.

## A Stone’s Ongoing Tale

**1. Cankarjev dom Forecourt, Ljubljana (2005)**
Two thousand square metres of bush-hammered Lipica Unito pave the plaza outside Slovenia’s main cultural hall, giving theatergoers a textured, non-slip carpet of silver-grey stone that glows under stage-door lights.

**2. Slovenian Pavilion, Milan World Expo (2015)**
Architects wrapped the pavilion in slim exterior fins and laid interior floors of the same limestone, turning the building into a traveling calling-card for the nation’s “stone DNA.” Visitors stepped from Italy into a slice of Karst plateau without crossing a border.

**3. Umag Seafront Promenade, Croatia (2021)**
A 5,600 m² ribbon of honed Lipica Unito tiles now lines the Adriatic waterfront. The smooth-but-grippy finish stands up to salty spray, bicycle tires, and evening strolls, all while mirroring the grey of distant Karst cliffs.

**4. House in the Olive Grove, near Rovinj (2022)**
Flamed terrace decks of Lipica Unito merge house and hillside; inside, honed slabs keep rooms cool beneath summer suns. The single stone palette ties modern minimalism to the rocky Istrian soil outside every window.

**5. “Dive into Immortality” Sculpture, Grožnjan (2023)**
At the Karst Stone Festival, an artist carved an 8-tonne block into an abstract swimmer leaping through space. The polished fossil flecks catch daylight, making the figure seem to ripple like water—proof that the ancient limestone still lends fresh life to new art.
